You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once.

Roll the superiority die, and add it to the level at which you are casting the power. You can choose to cast it at this new power level or lower.</p>\n<h3>Runtime Extension</h3>\n<p>When a tech power you cast with a duration of 1 minute or longer reaches the end of its duration, you may expend a superiority die to extend the duration of the power a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on your superiority die.</p>\n<h3>Subtle Execution</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power, you may expend a superiority die to cast the power without any visual or auditory cues.

If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects.</p>\n<h3>Intelligence Core Override</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>You can cast the @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.NagD6z90jRyd7zOk]{Override Interface} tech power at 5th level without spending tech points.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Resource Appropriation</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\n<p>If you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining.

When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect.

Those scholars who choose the Doctor Pursuit use their knowledge to mend their allies on the field and deal crippling blows with surgical precision.</p>\n<h2>Medical Practitioner</h2>\n<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with biochemist's kits and your choice of Medicine or Nature skills. Additionally, when you make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h2>Remote Healer</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you have learned to deploy medicine from a range. When you use a maneuver targeting an ally that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, that maneuver's range becomes 30 feet.</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into the medical arts. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Adrenaline Hit</h3>\n<p>You can use an action and expend one superiority die to inject a creature with regenerative medication that temporarily enhances their agility. When you do so, a creature you can touch regains hit points equal to the superiority die roll. Additionally, until the start of your next turn, when that creature would take damage, the amount is reduced by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Emergency Prescription</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die and touch a creature. That creature regains hit points equal to result of the die + your Intelligence modifier, and when that creature makes their first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw before the start of your next turn they roll the superiority die and add it to the roll.</p>\n<h3>Enhancement Injection</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die to inject a creature you can touch with enhancements, granting them temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Intelligence modifier, which last for 1 minute. Additionally, when the target makes a Strength or Constitution check or saving throw while it has these temporary hit points, it gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Neuroblock</h3>\n<p>When you make an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the attack roll. On a hit, the creature's next attack has disadvantage and it cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Reassure</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die and call out to a creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you that is charmed, frightened, or stunned. When you do so, that creature immediately makes another saving throw, adding the amount rolled to the save.</p>\n<h3>Remove Toxins</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die to purge the toxins from a creature you can touch. The target regains hit points equal to the number rolled and, if it is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.</p>\n<h3>Smelling Salts</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can expend a superiority die to heal a creature you can touch by a number of hit points equal to the number rolled.</p>\n<h3>Transfusion</h3>\n<p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with a finesse melee weapon, you can expend a superiority to give you or an ally that is within 5 feet of the creature a transfusion. Add the superiority dice to the damage you deal. You or your ally gain hit points equivalent to the damage you deal to the creature.</p>\n<p>You can be the creature hit with the attack as long as there is an ally with 5 feet of you, in which you can let it hit without rolling an attack and must choose an ally to heal with the transfusion.</p>\n<h3>Weak Point Strike</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to temporarily daze the creature. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<h2>Field Surgeon</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can roll an additional die d6 and add it to the roll. This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d8 at 7th level, 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, if the creature is the target of your Critical Analysis, you can instead choose the maximum on both dice. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 11th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>\n<h2>Resuscitate</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, through your medical studies you have learned to delay seemingly inevitable death. As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Panacea</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you've developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.</p>\n<p>The target has its exhaustion level reduced by one and regains all of its hit points. If the target is diseased, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends.</p>\n<p>Once you create a panacea, you can't create another until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Doctor)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the medical arts. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Remote Healer</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 12th level</em>&nbsp;<br />The range of your Remote Healer feature increases to 60 feet.</p>\n<h3>Experimental Treatments</h3>\n<p>Your medication and treatments are known to be untested and unstable. Immediately after you use a maneuver that causes a creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, you can choose to roll on the Side Effects table to the right. The condition or effect lasts until the creature completes a long rest, or you use this feature again.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>From the Brink</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em>&nbsp;<br />If the target of your Critical Analysis feature would be reduced to 0 hp, you may use your reaction and end your Critical Analysis feature to have them be reduced to 1 hp instead. Once a creature has benefited from this feature, they must complete a long rest before they can do so again.</p>\n<h3>Health Advisor</h3>\n<p>Whenever a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature begins their turn, you can use your reaction to give them temporary hit points equal to one-fourth your scholar level (rounded down) + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) which last until the start of their next turn.</p>\n<h3>Patient Protector</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em>&nbsp;<br />When you attack creatures that are within 5 feet of an ally that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, attack rolls and damage rolls made on them with a finesse or ranged weapon may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength of Dexterity.</p>\n<h3>Surgical Precision</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th Level</em>&nbsp;<br />When you hit a creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature with a weapon attack, it takes additional damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<h3>Tend the Wounded</h3>\n<p>If you or any friendly creatures you can touch regain hit points by spending one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, each of those creatures regain 1d6 extra hit points.</p>\n<p>This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d8 at 7th level, 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Side Effects</strong></p>\n<div class=\"medtable\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center; width: 41px;\">d20</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: left; width: 499px;\">Side Effects</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 39px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left; width: 497px;\">The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment.

You delve into the secrets of the body, learning as much medical knowledge as you can get your hands on, regardless of how dirty the work becomes.</p>\n<h2>General Practice</h2>\n<p>When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine, and you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for checks made with it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can expend one use of a medkit to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest.

Over the course of a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to create your modified biochemist's pack. You must have a biochemist's kit, a poisoner's kit, and materials in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your biochemist's pack is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified biochemist's pack has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>Your modified biochemist's pack comes equipped with a chemical distribution system, complete with three chemical mixtures: corrosive, invigorating, and noxious. As an action, you can activate your distributor and target a creature within 30 feet, with an effect determined by the mixture.</p>\n<h3>Corrosive Mixture</h3>\n<p>Your distributor emits a burst of acid. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier acid damage. This mixture's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>\n<h3>Invigorating Mixture</h3>\n<p>Your distributor emits a bolt of kolto. The target gains 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier temporary hit points, which last until the end of your next turn. The temporary hit points granted by this mixture increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>\n<h3>Noxious Mixture</h3>\n<p>Your distributor emits a cloud of poison. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier poison damage. This mixture's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>\n<h2>Biochemist's Touch</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, whenever you grant temporary hit points, or deal acid or poison damage using a tech power or class feature, you may expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to increase the potency. When you do so, the amount of temporary hit points you grant or damage you deal is increased by the amount rolled on the die. The damage is the same type as the original damage.</p>\n<h2>Potent Mixtures</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that grants temporary hit points, or deals acid or poison damage, you add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to the roll.</p>\n<h2>Epicenter</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, as a reaction when you take damage from a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see, you can use one of your mixtures. The effects of the mixture release in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you, and if the mixture requires a saving throw, you automatically succeed on it. Additionally, the affected area is difficult terrain to creatures other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Masterful Mixtures</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, when you deal acid or poison damage using a tech power or class feature, you ignore resistance and treat immunity as resistance.</p>\n<h2>Biochem Modifications</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Biochemist's Amplifer</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You gain a +1 bonus to tech attack rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Biochemist's Inhibitor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You gain a +1 bonus to your tech save DC. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3>Chemical Counteragents</h3>\n<p>You may choose one type of damage that benefits from your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixtures features. While wearing your modified biochemist's pack you have resistance to that type of damage.</p>\n<p>You can select this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.</p>\n<h3>Countertoxin</h3>\n<p>When you or an ally within 30 feet of you is suffering from the poisoned condition, you may use your reaction on your turn to end the poisoned condition on that creature. The creature also gains immunity to the poisoned condition for one minute.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Detachable Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor with a secondary, detachable distributor. As a bonus action, you can throw your detachable distributor at a point within range. Your detachable distributor has a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Your detachable distributor works for 1 minute before coming inert. Once it does so, you can't use it again until you recover it as an action.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while your detachable distributor is within 100 feet of you, when you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to affect each creature within 5 feet of your detachable distributor.

You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Drone Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor, interfacing it with the target of your @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.PopHJSVZq9t1FFf5]{Tracker Droid Interface}&nbsp;power. When you use your action to activate your distributor, while your tracker droid is within 100 feet of you, you can choose to have your tracker droid deliver the mixture. Your tracker droid must use its reaction to deliver the mixture.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Chemicals: Combustibles</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You add additional chemicals to your modified biochemist's pack. When you deal fire damage with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a creature fails their Dexterity saving throw against your Corrosive Mixtures feature, you can choose to instead deal fire damage. If you do so, each creature within 5 feet of the target takes fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Chemicals: Cryogenics</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You add additional chemicals to your modified biochemist's pack. When you deal cold damage with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a creature fails their Constitution saving throw against your Noxious Mixtures feature, you can choose to instead deal cold damage. If you do so, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Chemicals: Restorative</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You add additional chemicals to your modified biochemist's pack. When you restore hit points with a tech power or class feature, you can use your Biochemist's Touch and Potent Mixture features.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you use your Invigorating Mixture to grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can choose to restore that many hit points to the same creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Mixtures: Adhesive</h3>\n<p>You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature is Large or larger, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn. As an action on their turn, an affected creature can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Mixtures: Blinding</h3>\n<p>You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Expanded Mixtures: Hallucinogenic</h3>\n<p>You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the end of your next turn. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<p>Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.</p>\n<p>This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h3>Explosive Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor, granting it the ability to create a volley. When you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to affect each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 30 feet.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Injection Apparatus</h3>\n<p>You install a wrist mounted injection apparatus into your modified biochemist's pack. It is a simple vibroweapon with the finesse and light properties, and deals 1d4 kinetic damage on a hit. Your injection apparatus does not fill the hand slot, but you can't use it while the hand is full.</p>\n<p>When you hit with the weapon, you can activate your distributor to deploy one of your mixtures. If you do so, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw against your mixture.</p>\n<h3>Inoculation</h3>\n<p>You gain immunity to the poisoned and diseased conditions.</p>\n<h3>Integrated EVA Functionality</h3>\n<p>You make several additions to your modified biochemist's pack, you are protected from hazardous conditions, as if wearing an EVA suit, for as long as you are wearing your modified biochemist's pack.</p>\n<h3>Kolto Aerosol</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em> <br />You add a special dispersal system to your modified biochemist's pack. This system slowly disperses small amounts of kolto in the air. If creatures spend the entirety of a long rest within 30 feet of you, they regain all expended Hit Dice, instead of only half. Additionally, they are cured of any poisons or diseases that are suffering from.</p>\n<h3>Long-Range Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor, improving the range. When you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to increase the range to 60 feet.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Luminous Gel</h3>\n<p>You've added a light-emitting gel to your modified biochemist's pack. As an action, you can coat an item, object, or location up to 5-foot-square with this gel. When you do so, the gel sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The gel lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. You can end this effect as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Oil Spill</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can cast the <em>oil slick</em> tech power without expending tech points. Casting the power in this way does not require concentration, and the oil will remain in place for the full duration of the power.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Persistent Chemicals</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br />Whenever you use your Biochemist's Touch feature, you may select one creature that was damaged. At the start of each of that creature's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage of the triggering type equal to your Intelligence modifier and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. On a success, this feature ends, and the creature becomes immune to it for one day.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Piercing Gel</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Luminous Gel</em> <br />Your luminous gel now automatically dispels illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\n<h3>Self-Injection Module</h3>\n<p>You install a special kolto injector into your modified biochemist's pack that can inject you with kolto in response to pain. When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend a Hit Die to regain health as long as the damage would not reduce your hit points to 0.</p>\n<h3>Smart Dispersal System</h3>\n<p>When you activate your distributor, you can choose a number of creature equal to your Intelligence modifier. Those creature automatically succeed on their saving throws against your mixtures.</p>\n<h3>Spray Distribution System</h3>\n<p>You upgrade your distributor, granting it the ability to spray in a cone. When you use your action to activate your distributor, you can choose to affect each creature in a 15-foot cone.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once).

Each creature gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws until the end of their next short or long rest. If a creature was already proficient in Constitution saving throws, they instead become proficient in a saving throw of your choice. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h2>Balanced Diet</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, your cooking is so nutritionally balanced that it allows allies to stave off the effects of continued rigorous activity. Creatures of your choice who eat food prepared by you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to avoid Exhaustion, as described in chapter 8, until the end of their next long rest.</p>\n<h2>Comfort Food</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, if you or any friendly creatures who have consumed food you prepared during a short rest regain hit points by spending hit dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d8 hit points.</p>\n<p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Heroes' Feast</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you have developed a signature feast that is the purest distillation of your knowledge and talent as a chef.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a long rest, you can expend rare culinary supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your feast, which can feed a number of creatures equal to twice your Intelligence modifier. Any creature partaking in the feast gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is cured of all poisons and disease, and becomes immune to poison and disease.</li>\n<li>It makes Wisdom saving throws to avoid being frightened with advantage.</li>\n<li>Its hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These benefits last until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Chef)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the culinary arts. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Alternative Fuel</h3>\n<p>Any of your chef features, maneuvers, or discoveries can now effect droids and constructs.</p>\n<h3>Banquet</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 17th level, </em><em>Full Course</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of four).</p>\n<h3>Filling Meal</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize up to two different maneuvers from this archetype, rather than one.</p>\n<h3>Full Course</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 12th level, </em><em>Filling Meal</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of three).</p>\n<h3>On the Rocks</h3>\n<p>Any food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional cooling effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes fire damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.</p>\n<h3>Secret Ingredient</h3>\n<p>If you or any friendly creature that has consumed food made by you during their last short or long rest gains temporary hit points, the number of temporary hit points they gain increases by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Spice of Life</h3>\n<p>Any food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional warming effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes cold damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Expanded Content","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":1900001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"LlSPdievDmlXzGGu"}
{"name":"Gambler Pursuit","permission":{"default":0,"IpSq6HI4edO6e0Yw":3,"e7TQvuAZ89BXn8Uz":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Gambler Pursuit</h1>\n<p>Not all studied men and women use their intelligence and skill for the pursuit of knowledge, but instead turn to the various casinos and betting halls of the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Gambler Pursuit use their knowledge of probability and risk to attempt to master games of chance and build their fortune, or lose it all along the way.</p>\n<h2>Gambler's Aptitude</h2>\n<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of the Insight, Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand skills. Additionally, you gain proficiency in three gaming sets of your choice, and you have advantage on any ability check you make that uses any of these gaming sets.</p>\n<h2>Risk versus Reward</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, when you make your first attack on your turn against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can decide to gamble by rolling a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn. On a roll of 3 or lower, that creature instead has advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 7th level, to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>All In</h3>\n<p>When you make an attack roll, and the result is less than 20, you can expend a superiority die and roll it, adding it to the roll. If the resulting sum is 20 or 23, the attack is considered a critical hit.</p>\n<h3>Blind Luck</h3>\n<p>When you fail an ability check, you can expend a superiority die. If the result of your ability check plus the superiority die is within a range equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) above or below the check's DC, you pass the check instead.</p>\n<h3>Double Bluff</h3>\n<p>If on the same round of combat that you have missed a weapon attack, an enemy also misses you with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and make a single weapon attack, adding the results of your superiority die to both the attack and damage rolls.</p>\n<h3>The Idiot's Array</h3>\n<p>When a creature hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you take minimum damage on the damage roll and subtract the value of the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead take the maximum.</p>\n<h3>Played Their Hand</h3>\n<p>When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the attacker's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice) as a part of this reaction. On a success, the target drops the weapon it made the attack with. If you are within 5 feet of the target, and you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, the object lands at its feet.</p>\n<h3>Pure Sabacc</h3>\n<p>When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you deal maximum damage on the weapon's damage roll, including the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead deal the minimum.</p>\n<h3>Raise the Stakes</h3>\n<p>When the target of your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. Roll the die and subtract the result from the enemy's attack roll, but add the result to their damage roll on a hit.</p>\n<h3>Take a Chance</h3>\n<p>Before making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.</p>\n<h3>Tiebreaker</h3>\n<p>When you roll a superiority die as a part of a maneuver you learned from this class, you can expend another superiority die and use the total of both dice.</p>\n<h2>Lucky Number 7</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, whenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain a superiority die. You can not have more superiority dice than the amount shown in the Superiority Dice column of the Scholar class table.</p>\n<p>When attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.</p>\n<h2>Tell Me the Odds</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, if the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).</p>\n<p>This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h2>Borrowed Luck</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.</p>\n<p>While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Gambler)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Ace Up Your Sleeve</h3>\n<p>Whenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can expend a superiority die, adding the result to your total for the check.</p>\n<h3>Against the House</h3>\n<p>Whenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling, you can instead challenge the target to a game of chance. If they accept your offer, you can make an ability check with an available gaming set. If you win the challenge, you automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>\n<h3>Ante Up</h3>\n<p>When you roll initiative, are not surprised, and end up first in the initiative order, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action during your first turn in combat.</p>\n<h3>Calculated Bluff</h3>\n<p>When you make an ability check using your Charisma, you can choose to instead make the check using your Intelligence.</p>\n<h3>Cold Read</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you may make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by a target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you know the next action the target intends to take, so long as the situation does not change dramatically.</p>\n<h3>Feeling the Pressure</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\n<p>Whenever you roll a 4 or higher on your Risk Versus Reward feature, the target of your Critical Analysis feature also has disadvantage on attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>The Magic Number</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\n<p>Whenever you roll a 7 on an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the ability check or saving throw with advantage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Expanded Content","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":4200001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"MEXJtrbAMkHZtD0G"}

The Warchief Approach is one forged from alliances, bonds, and strategy. In combat, your rages are less mindless, and more focused. Ignoring the distractions of unimportant events, your attention hones in on the battlefield and how best to direct and control it. You guide your alliesâ€™ strikes, and your presence is enough to wash away their fatigue.</p>\n<h2>Savage Diplomat</h2>\n<p>Your path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself.</p>\n<p>When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.</p>\n<h2>Commanding Rage</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, when in your rage, you become more aware of your allies, and their intent when fighting at your side. While you are raging, when an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an enemy, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack and add your rage damage bonus to the damage roll, if the attack hits.</p>\n<h2>Inspiring Presence</h2>\n<p>At 6th level your mere presence on the battlefield rallies your allies.

On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers or features on your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Finding My Way</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Rush</em> <br />While you are playing an enhanced song, when a creature makes a melee attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, imposing disadvantage on the roll.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Hypnotic Melody</h3>\n<p>As an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can begin to play a song woven with subtle hypnotic influence. Choose a number of creature up to your Intelligence modifier. If those creatures listen to this song for a full minute, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed the saving throw are not aware that you attempted to influence them, nor are creatures that failed their saving throw once the power ends.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Inaudible Casting</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Simple Melodies</em> <br />When you cast a tech power or make use of a feature that requires playing your modified instrument, you can choose to do so quietly. Creatures have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sound to determine you cast a tech power.</p>\n<h3>Long Range Noise</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em> <br />The radius of your songs increases to 120 feet.

They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.</p>\n<h2>Clinch Strike</h2>\n<p>When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or a medium or heavy shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your unarmed strikes use a d4 for damage.</li>\n<li>You can deal Sneak Attack damage when making an unarmed strike. Additionally, you don't need advantage on your unarmed attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</li>\n<li>You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Skilled Grappler</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.</p>\n<p>Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Grapple Technique save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.</p>\n<h3>Constrict</h3>\n<p>You attempt to choke the target into unconscious-ness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.</p>\n<p>If you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.</p>\n<h3>Disarm</h3>\n<p>You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</p>\n<h3>Hip Toss</h3>\n<p>You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.</p>\n<h2>Human Shield</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 9th level you learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.</p>\n<h2>Kiss the Wall</h2>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, you can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed attack you make against a creature grappled by you, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>\n<h2>Neck Snap</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, you learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. If the target has more than 100 hit points, it immediately takes 10d10 kinetic damage.

When you use a Force-Empowered Self feature, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain.

You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water, and you no longer need to sleep.

The creature is then forced to make an attack on the ally instead. If the attack misses, the ally can immediately make a weapon attack against that creature as a part of that same reaction.

Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.</p>\n<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>\n<p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.

The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>\n<p>The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Coercing Shot</h3>\n<p>You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Explosive Shot</h3>\n<p>You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.</p>\n<p>The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Hallucinogen Shot</h3>\n<p>You enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Piercing Shot</h3>\n<p>You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p>The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Quell Shot</h3>\n<p>You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h3>Seeking Shot</h3>\n<p>You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.</p>\n<p>The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Shot</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you gain the ability to enhance your shots. Whenever you fire an unenhanced shot from a blaster, you can make it enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</p>\n<h2>Redirected Shot</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, you learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with an enhanced shot and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.</p>\n<h2>Ever-Ready Shot</h2>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, your enhanced ammunition is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Special Ammunition remaining, you regain one use of it.</p>\n<h2>Ammunition Upgrades</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, your ammunition enhancements improve.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Expanded Content","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":2800001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"jT2M5xEkkNy98lnZ"}

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with gadgeteer's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\n<h2>Gadgeteer Harness</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to create and modify adventuring gear utilizing your gadgeteer experience. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to create your modified gadgeteer harness. You must have gadgeteer's implements and materials in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your gadgeteer harness is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your gadgeteer harness has 4 modification slots to which you can affix gadgets, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws.

A creature can only have one barrier active at a time.</p>\n<h3>Environmental Barrier</h3>\n<p>You project an environmental barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or sonic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage.</p>\n<h3>Physical Barrier</h3>\n<p>You project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level (rounded down).

You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Reinforced Barriers</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, when you cast a tech power while you have a barrier active, you can restore hit points to the barrier, provided it is within 30 feet of you. You restore a number of hit points equal to twice the power's level, or 1 hit point for an at-will power. This can't increase a barrier's hit points above its initial hit points. If you have multiple barriers active, you can divide these hit points between them as you see fit.</p>\n<h2>Adaptive Barrier</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, when a creature who has one of your barriers within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage, and that damage is of a type that could be affected by that barrier, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to the triggering damage. If that damage is the same type as the barrier's chosen damage, you instead grant them immunity. Whether resistance or immunity, the barrier immediately drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<h2>Gadgeteer Contraptions</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Grounding System</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Prototype Grounding System</em></p>\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you have immunity to lightning damage.</p>\n<h3>Auto-Injection Regenerator</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You install a special kolto injector into your gadgeteer harness that can inject you with kolto in response to pain.

Your mimicker casts a shadow that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function for 1 minute. Your mimicker is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.</p>\n<h3>Miniaturized Hydraulics</h3>\n<p>Your gadgeteer harness can store 20 pounds of equipment without adding to your encumbrance.</p>\n<h3>Oil Spill</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can cast the <em>oil slick</em> tech power without expending tech points. Casting the power in this way does not require concentration, and the oil will remain in place for the full duration of the power.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Powered Grappling Hook</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em></p>\n<p>While your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Grounding System</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Grounding System</em></p>\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you have resistance to lightning damage.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Thruster</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Jet Pack</em></p>\n<p>While your jet pack is activated, your flying speed is now 45 feet.</p>\n<h3>Quick Start Engine</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Jet Pack</em></p>\n<p>You can now activate your Jet Pack as an object interaction rather than as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Recycled Adrenals</h3>\n<p>You can augment a single adrenal to regain its charge. This adrenal can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this adrenal, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recycled Explosives</h3>\n<p>You can augment a single explosive to regain its charge. This explosive can only be used by you, and it uses your tech save DC instead of its own, unless its own DC would be higher. Once you've used this explosive, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Recycled Stimpacs</h3>\n<p>You can augment a single stimpac to regain its charge. This stimpac can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this stimpac, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Sentry Turret</h3>\n<p>You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. If a creature would be targeted by more than one of these sentries, it only makes this saving throw once, taking an additional d4 damage for each sentry beyond the first.</p>\n<p>The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Shocking Hook</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em></p>\n<p>After hitting a creature with your grappling hook, you can use the connection to deliver an at-will tech power. As a bonus action, you can cast an at-will tech power at the target with a range of touch. If the power requires an attack roll, you have advantage. If the target requires a saving throw, the target has disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover the harpoon.</p>\n<h3>Stealth Field Generator</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>You create an augmented belt that functions as a portable, personal cloaking device. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks that rely on sight. The generator lasts for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you make an attack or cast a force- or tech- power.</p>\n<p>Once the belt has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Shocking Barrier</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You enhanced your barriers. Whenever a creature with one of your barriers active takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of it, the damaged creature can roll your Potent Aptitude die, dealing the result of the die as lightning damage to the creature that damaged it.</p>\n<h3>Truesight Goggles</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Darkvision Goggles</em></p>\n<p>You modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Integration</h3>\n<p>You can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your gadgeteer harness. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden and fixed properties.</p>\n<h3>Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</h3>\n<p>You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":4100001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"mPPGM8DkcIXCvY5a"}

Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your tracker droid.</p>\n<p>If your tracker droid is irreparable destroyed, or you want to interface with a different tracker droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one tracker droid companion at a time.</p>\n<p>Your tracker droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tracker droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your tracker droid acts on its own.</li>\n<li>Your tracker droid's level equals your operative level, and for each operative level you gain after 3rd, your tracker droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.</li>\n<li>Your tracker droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.</li>\n<li>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your tracker droid's abilities also improve.

Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d4 ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.</p>\n<h3>Saboteur Practice Techcasting</h3>\n<h2>Sabotage</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.</p>\n<p>On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>At the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Generating Your Tracker Droid</h2>\n<p>Choosing your tracker droid companion is an integral part of being an Saboteur Operative.

You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Imaging Amplifier</h3>\n<p>You integrate a booster in your wristpad that enhances your illusionary tech powers. While wielding this amplifier, when a creature attempts an Intelligence (Investigation) check against a tech power you cast to discern the illusion for what it is, you can force the creature to have disadvantage on the roll (no action required). Alternatively, when you cast the <em>mirror image</em> tech power, you create a fourth duplicate. While you have four duplicates, you must roll a 5 or higher on the d20 roll to change an attack's target to a duplicate.</p>\n<p>You can use this amplifier a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Jet Boots</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br />You find tune your augmented boots to give you temporary, limited flight. Activating or deactivating the boots requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<p>The rocket boots last for 1 minute before deactivating. Once the boots have been activated, they can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Mechanical Arm</h3>\n<p>You create a mechanical arm which mounts to your shoulder, which you can use independently. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time.</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification twice.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Biotic Amplifier</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Biotic Amplifier</em> <br />You fine tune your biotic amplifier. While wielding this amplifier, when a creature gains temporary hit points from your biotic amplifier, it instead gains twice as many. This amount can't exceed the number of hit points regained.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Corrosive Amplifier</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Corrosive Amplifier</em> <br />You fine tune your Corrosive Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the next attack roll made against that creature before the end of its next turn has advantage.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Cryo Amplifier</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Cryo Amplifier</em> <br />You fine tune your Cryo Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn. If the tech power already reduces the creature's speed, that amount is instead increased by 5 feet.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Explosive Amplifier</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Explosive Amplifier</em> <br />You fine tune your Explosive Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the creature is also ignited for 1 minute. At the start of each of its turns, the creature takes additional fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier and then makes a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC, ending this effect on a success.</p>\n<p>If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames, the effect ends.</p>\n<h3>Powered Grappling Hook</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em> <br />While your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.</p>\n<h3>Sentry Turret</h3>\n<p>You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and its speed is reduced by 5 until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Truesight Goggles</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Darkvision Goggles</em> <br />You modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</h3>\n<p>You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Expanded Content","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":2100001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"nypIEt3lfyjKLO7S"}

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw to end the effect.</p>\n<h3>Daring Escape</h3>\n<p>You can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action until the end of your turn. Until the end of this turn, you have advantage on all Strength (Athletics) checks.</p>\n<h3>Covering Fire</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.</p>\n<p>That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>\n<h3>Disarming Shot</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. Add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>\n<h3>Distracting Shot</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Exploit Weakness</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>\n<h3>Penetrating Shot</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose up to two creatures within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature(s), it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die.</p>\n<p>The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<h3>Precision Attack</h3>\n<p>When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<h3>Return Fire</h3>\n<p>When a creature misses you with a ranged attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a ranged weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<h2>Mark of the Deadeye</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, the range of your Ranger's Quarry feature doubles.

When a creature attempts to make an opportunity attack against an allied creature, or forces your ally to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make an attack roll against the enemy creature.</p>\n<p>If your attack hits, either impose disadvantage on the enemy creature's opportunity attack roll or grant advantage to any allies making the saving throw.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":2300001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"qGO6c9LNWrUdNyCs"}

As an action, you can spend three of your barrier's hit points to create a unique effect. You have three such effects: Projected Sphere, Projected Maelstrom, and Projected Wave. When you use your Projected Barrier, you choose which effect to create.</p>\n<p>Some Projected Barrier Effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>If your barrier's hit points are reduced to 0, any Projected Barrier features immediately end.</p>\n<h3>Projected Sphere</h3>\n<p>You create a protective spherical barrier barrier in a 5-foot-radius sphere a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures within the barrier have three-quarters cover from attacks originating from outside the barrier. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required).</p>\n<h3>Projected Maelstrom</h3>\n<p>You create an unstable energy maelstrom in a 5-foot cube at a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. A creature takes 4d4 energy damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required).</p>\n<p>This feature's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 11th level (5d4) and 17th level (6d4).</p>\n<h3>Projected Wave</h3>\n<p>You create a wave of barrier energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 energy damage and is pushed back to the edge of the cone. On a success, they take half damage and aren't pushed.</p>\n<p>This feature's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).</p>\n<h2>Regenerative Shielding</h2>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, when a hostile creature forces you to make a saving throw and you succeed, your personal barrier regains hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h2>Adaptive Barrier</h2>\n<p>At 15th level, when your personal barrier takes damage, you can have it gain resistance to subsequent damage of that type until the start of your next turn (no action required). If it takes damage of more than one type simultaneously, you can choose which type it gains resistance to. Your barrier can only have resistance to one type of damage at a time.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":1800001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"ysEhybtdsk9Um6AP"}

Those sentinels who follow the Path of Synthesis blend their intricate mastery of the Force with their understanding of technology, creating unique effects to overcome their obstacles.</p>\n<h2>Techcasting Secrets</h2>\n<p>Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you have learned to intersperse your training with an aptitude for technology. Choose two tech powers of 1st-level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel class table. You still require the aid of a wristpad for these powers.</p>\n<p>At 7th-level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd-level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd-level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th-level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power.</p>\n<h2>Synthetic Understanding</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you deal damage with a tech power or Kinetic Combat attack, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.</p>\n<h2>Force-Empowered Tech</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, you learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Disruption Pulse</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.</p>\n<h3>Forced Override</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Insight</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.</p>\n<h2>Improved Force-Empowered Tech</h2>\n<p>By 13th level, you've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.</p>\n<h3>Harmonic Synthesis</h3>\n<p>When you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.</p>\n<h3>Conservation of Energy</h3>\n<p>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).</p>\n<h2>Reflective Shield</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, when you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the incoming energy and potentially reflect it back at your attacker. You use your reaction to have resistance against the triggering damage, and if the source of the damage is within 5 feet of you, they take half of the total damage dealt as ion.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Expanded Content","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"armorproperties":{"parts":[]},"weaponproperties":{"parts":[]}},"folder":null,"sort":6500001,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"ysfl4v1eY0OUiPx7"}

While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.</p>\n<h2>Enforcer</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, when you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
